Download the glove.6B.100d.txt file for this baseline.

Run the NLP_P1_Glove.ipynb file in the same folder as the glove.6B.100d.txt, P1_training_set.csv and P1_testing_set.csv files. 
If you are running this on colab the glove.6B.100d.txt file may take a while to upload as it is a huge file.

The packages required to run this file are tensorflow, keras and nltk.

The first cell specifies the nltk downloads required to run the file. 
On executing the nltk.download() command, the downloader appears. 
Enter 'd' for download and 'all' to identify all the packages to be downloaded. 
This takes about a minute. Once done, enter 'q' to quit the downloader.

Then execute each cell in sequence in the rest of the notebook.

The last cell is where the neural network uses tensorflow and it can throw some warnings  depending on the system on which the file is run. This can be ignored. 
The test set result is displayed in terms of [loss, accuracy].
