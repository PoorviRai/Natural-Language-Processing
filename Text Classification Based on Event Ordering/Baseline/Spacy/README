Run the NLP_P1_Spacy.ipynb file in the same folder as the P1_training_set.csv and P1_testing_set.csv files. 

The packages required to run this file are tensorflow, keras, nltk and the pre-trained spacy model 'en_core_web_sm'.
If model can be installed using the command: python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm.

The first cell specifies the nltk downloads required to run the file. On executing the nltk.download() command, the downloader apperas. 
Enter 'd' for download and 'all' to identify all the packages to be downloaded.
This takes about a minute. Once done, enter 'q' to quit the downloader.

Then execute each cell in sequence in the rest of the notebook.

The last cell is where the neural network uses tensorflow and it can throw some warnings  depending on the system on which the file is run. 
This can be ignored. 
The test set result is displayed in terms of accuracy.
