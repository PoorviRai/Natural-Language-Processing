Run the NLP_P1_MyApproach.ipynb file in the same folder as the P1_training_set.csv and P1_testing_set.csv files.

The packages required to run this file are tensorflow, keras and nltk.

The first cell specifies the nltk downloads required to run the file. 
On executing the nltk.download() command, the downloader appears. Enter 'd' for download and 'all' to identify all the packages to be downloaded. This takes about a minute. Once done, enter 'q' to quit the downloader.

Then execute each cell in sequence in the rest of the notebook.

The second last cell, where the vectors are being assigned, might throw a warning 'INFO:tensorflow:Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore'. This can be ignored as I have ensured that all the vectors do indeed get stored in the variables.

The neural network uses tensorflow and can also throw some warnings  depending on the system on which the file is run. This can also be ignored. 

The test set result is displayed in terms of [loss, accuracy].
